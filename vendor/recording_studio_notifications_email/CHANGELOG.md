All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-01

### Changed

- `Event` uses `delivery_payload_for` when a delivery is present.
- Require `recording_studio_notifications` `>= 0.3.0`.

### Upgrade notes

- Install `recording_studio_notifications` `0.3.0` first.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-01
