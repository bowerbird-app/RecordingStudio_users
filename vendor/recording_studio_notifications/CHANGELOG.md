## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added
- Delivery payload resolver API: `register_delivery_payload_resolver` and `delivery_payload_for`. Resolved output is transient and is never persisted on the notification or delivery.
- Optional `available_for?(recipient:, notification: nil, delivery: nil)` on channel adapters. Inapplicable optional channels are skipped; inapplicable required channels raise.

### Changed
- README adapter docs now describe `available_for?` and delivery payload resolvers for sensitive content such as OTP codes.

### Upgrade notes
- Adapters may implement `available_for?(recipient:, notification: nil, delivery: nil)`. Optional channels are skipped when not applicable; required channels that are not applicable raise an error.
- Sensitive content (for example OTP codes) must not be stored in persisted `title`, `body`, or `metadata`. Register a delivery payload resolver instead; email and push adapters should call `delivery_payload_for` at send time. Notification types without a resolver continue to use the stored `title`, `body`, and `url`.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed
- Required channel pills on notification settings no longer show "(required)" or a remove control; hovering shows a tooltip explaining the channel cannot be removed.
- Required channels no longer appear in the notification settings channel dropdown list; they stay visible as non-removable pills in the select. When a type has no optional channels the whole channel select is disabled rather than hidden.
- Corrected Tailwind `@source` paths for `app/assets/tailwind/application.css` so they resolve from Rails.root (`../../../vendor/bundle/...`) and match git-gem folder names (`flatpack-*`, `recording_studio_notifications-*`).
- Updated the dummy app Tailwind sources so FlatPack components and Recording Studio gem views are scanned during `tailwindcss:build`.

### Changed
- Installed `recording_studio_notifications_email` in the dummy app and exposed `email` as an optional channel on its notification types.

### Upgrade notes
- If your host Tailwind entry still uses the old install-generator lines (`../../vendor/bundle/**/flatpack/...` or `**/recording_studio_notifications/...` without a `-*` suffix), replace them with the paths from `rails generate recording_studio_notifications:install` (or the README), then run `bin/rails tailwindcss:build`.
- Prefer `bundle config set --local path vendor/bundle` (or an equivalent Bundler path that the `@source` globs cover) so Tailwind can see gem templates.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- Removed grouped notification accordion border bleed in FlatPack versions that render item border wrappers at deeper selector depth.
- Finalized dummy seeded cadence rollups during seeding so grouped in-app notifications are immediately visible in demo inbox/menu views.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed
- Deferred grouped cadence delivery for all channels, including `:in_app`, when rollups are enabled.
- Hid pending in-app rollup notifications from inbox/menu until the cadence period closes and rollup delivery completes.
- Removed persistent accordion item borders in grouped notification rows to keep list styling consistent.

### Changed
- Updated cadence docs and dummy app cadence coverage to reflect deferred in-app rollup behavior.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-07-17

### Fixed
- Scoped notification menu and /notifications inbox visibility to the current root plus rootless notifications, excluding notifications from other workspace roots.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-07-17

### Fixed
- Restored async notification-menu polling by correcting namespaced Stimulus data attribute keys in the menu helper.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-17

### Changed
- Updated FlatPack to `v0.1.127`.
- Removed the extra content padding from grouped notification accordions.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- A cleared notification state and a Clear all action for unread inbox items.
- Unread notification counts on inbox groups.

### Changed
- Notification settings now group types by category and present channel and frequency controls side by side.
- Required channels and required cadences are shown as disabled controls with their selected values visible.

### Removed
- The abandoned notification cadence and digest implementation, including its database tables, scheduler, settings, seed data, and documentation. Notifications now use the standard immediate delivery path.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-28

### Changed
- Bumped the dummy app FlatPack dependency from `0.1.2` to `0.1.33` and pinned it by tag in `test/dummy/Gemfile`

## [0.1.0] - 2025-12-04

### Added
- Initial release
- Rails mountable engine structure
- PostgreSQL with UUID primary keys support
- TailwindCSS v4 integration
- GitHub Codespaces devcontainer configuration
- Docker Compose setup with PostgreSQL and Redis
- Install generator for host applications
- Comprehensive README and documentation
